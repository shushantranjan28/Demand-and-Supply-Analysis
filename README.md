## Demand and Supply Analysis for Ride-Hailing Service

### Project Description

In this data analysis project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of a ride-hailing service to understand the relationship between demand and supply factors. The dataset used in this project contains information about the number of drivers and riders active per hour, as well as the total number of rides completed.

### Data Preprocessing

The initial step involved data preprocessing, where I checked for missing values and removed instances with missing ride completion information. After cleaning the dataset, I calculated various statistics to better understand the data distribution.

### Demand and Supply Analysis

To visualize the relationship between demand and supply, I created a scatter plot with a trendline using Plotly Express. The x-axis represented the number of active drivers per hour (supply), while the y-axis represented the number of active riders per hour (demand). The trendline helped us identify any correlation between these two variables.

### Elasticity Calculation

Next, I calculated the elasticity of demand with respect to the number of active drivers per hour. This allowed us to quantify the responsiveness of rider demand to changes in driver supply. The obtained elasticity value of 0.82 indicated the sensitivity of rider demand to changes in the number of active drivers.

### Supply Ratio Analysis

Additionally, I calculated the supply ratio for each level of driver activity. The supply ratio represents the number of rides completed per active driver per hour, offering insights into driver efficiency and service utilization.

### Project Conclusion

The analysis revealed valuable insights into the demand and supply dynamics of the ride-hailing service. Understanding the elasticity of demand helps optimize driver availability to meet rider demands effectively. Moreover, the supply ratio analysis sheds light on driver efficiency and can guide driver allocation strategies.

I presented the findings through interactive visualizations, including scatter plots and supply ratio trends, using Plotly graphing libraries. The project's results can be utilized to inform decision-making processes and optimize resource allocation in the ride-hailing service.

Through this project, I strengthened my skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and interactive data visualization using Python and Plotly libraries. The ability to analyze and interpret complex datasets is a valuable asset for data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.
